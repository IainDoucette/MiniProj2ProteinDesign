PDB Protein Design file runs a hallucination to generate some sequences that bind to thee inputted PDB. In this case, the PDB used was the sequence for EGFR, which is shown and linked within the script.

Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions takes a series of inputted sequences and predicts how well they will bind to a target sequence. In this case, EGFR is the target sequnce and the inputted sequences were th outputted sequenes from the PDB Protein Design file as well as sequences from others in class.
