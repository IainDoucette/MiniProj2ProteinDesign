PDB Protein Design file runs a hallucination to generate some sequences that bind to thee inputted PDB. In this case, the PDB used was the sequence for EGFR, which is shown and linked within the script.

Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions takes a series of inputted sequences and predicts how well they will bind to a target sequence. In this case, EGFR is the target sequnce and the inputted sequences were th outputted sequenes from the PDB Protein Design file as well as sequences from others in class. 

The Proj2MyProtein image is an image of the EGFR protein generated in PDB Protein Design

The Proj2ProteinFolding video shows the predicted folding pattern of the same protein in Proj2MyProtein

Proj2Sequence is the sequence of the protein generated to bind with EGFR.

ProteinStructure is the output from the AlphaFold protein structure database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) search for the sequence provided. The image shows TetR/AcrR family transcriptional regulator which had a 52% identity match to my sequence, meaning it was the closest match to my protein and should therefor be the most accurate folding prediction.
